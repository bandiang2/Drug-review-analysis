When it came to school work though I found that I needed the 30mg to increase my level of focus (and have been on it for a month since).  I had not experienced decreased appetite until about a month into taking the 20mg.  I find that the greatest benefit of Vyvanse for me is that it tends to stabalize my mood on a daily basis and lessens any bouts of anxiety and depression that i used to face before I was perscribed.,1

At first, within the first 1 day then couple of weeks after starting, this medicine is broken down by your body fast and you need to adjust your dose. Once I got past the ups and downs of the first week or two of getting this increased from .25 mg - 3 times per day to what I'm on now things are so stable and just smooth.","I first started taking this at 3 times per day with .25 mg pills. I was advised not to take as needed with my panic attacks as that would reinforce the idea of taking a pill when it's needed and not help me work around my anxiety. This is totally true. At first I wished to only take them as needed but with my doctor's advice, he was right. This really does work when you take it daily at 3-5 times per day. This way your body adjusts to what's going on with the panic and makes no association with taking a pill to prevent or stop it, they just don't start in the first place. Yes, I still do have minor attacks and worry episodes here and there but nothing at all like the many years before this. I wish that this extremely helpful medicine would not have such a bad name in media, news and pharmacies. This works wonders and there is no want or need to take more or become and addict. People and doctor's need to  understand more on how to treat someone with something that just WORKS, rather than trying to give them SSRI's which are what the drugs companies push, all for money reasons. And, the doctor's out there who decide that SSRI's are the only option, they need to go back to medical school!",1

Generic tablets are not high quality and somewhat expensive due to the need for a large quantity of tablets.,Switched from Adderall to Dexedrine to compare the effects. Dexedrine is simply dextroamphetamine while Adderall is a mixture of Amphetamine salts. This might explain the increased effectiveness of the Dexedrine contrary to popular belief.

I did turn very, very red around the perioral area and especially at the nasolabial folds.  My face felt as if I needed to peel it off and scratch deep down in the dermis.  In fact, that was my main complaint--the itchiness . . . and of course the dryness.  But the dryness was not nearly as bad as I expected.  For example, my lips never cracked.  However, I'm several years out from treatment , and I still have dry skin problems.  It's weird because my skin was always so oily and now it's dry.  But that could be attributed to normal aging.  Regardless, I've become a real connosiour of facial moisturizers.  My skin is also a little more sensitive post isotretinoin.  Tazorac one percent, which I used to slather on nightly like lotion, now sets me on fire if I dare to use the half percent version more than twice a week.  I know the literature claims there's no anti-aging efficacy if it isn't used daily, but I'm hoping for the best.","I have to confess that I'm confused by this section.

The formulation I was prescribed was 1 milligram, although I believe the usual prescription is for 2 milligrams and can go as high as 5 milligrams.

Possibly the worst side effect I experienced was a DECREASE in motivation.  If you read above, you may have noticed that one of the two reasons I sought treatment was to increase my motivation.  I had a hard time keeping my house clean and getting started on tasks.  Well, within two weeks of starting this medication, I began needing long naps (3+ hours) every day just to function.  I watched TV for the rest of the day.  I had no interest in work and basically messed around all day instead of working.  It was a severe decrease in motivation.

Also, I had no sex drive and was unable to orgasm.","I missed an appointment with my doctor and was not able to get a refill, so I have been off the Lexapro for a week.  In that time, I no longer needed to take naps and although I still procrastinate, it's back to the ""pre-Lexapro"" levels of procrastination, not the terrible levels I experienced while on the drug.  My temper did come back, though.  The withdrawals caused me to be so nauseous that I began throwing up and have had migraines ever since I stopped taking it.

the flavor is also quite pleasant","Actiq, when taken as directed, induces a feeling of numbness. and slurred speech is common. Thinking becomes confused and it is not unusual to fall asleep in mid-sentence. Actiq slows breathing and causes extreme tiredness.  Actiq are highly addictive and it is literally impossible to stop taking them without a medical detoxification.
Actiq delivered in subcutaneous form causes the teeth to rot after extended use of more than 6 months.","Actiq should only be taken by individuals who are in severe, chronic pain where
tolerance to the drug will not become problematic.  It needs to be closely monitored and locked away out of reach of children or any adult who may have problems with addiction.
My  chronic  pain condition was followed by a Pain Center at a reputable hospital.  The use of opioids were used only after all other treatments for
my condition had failed.
Unfortunately, once Actiq was introduced to me, my medical problems worsened, although my pain was under control.  I was unable to function responsibly, began dealing with symptoms of withdrawal whenever I didn't take it, which at times became worse than my actual pain and discomfort.  I became more of a patient to my family and on a side note, at age 40 lost 4 molars due to the ingredients present in the ""lollipops"" I was taking.
I had no choice but to be hospitalized for an inpatient medical detox in order to safely get this horrible drug out of my body.  Fortunately my husband and I were fortunate enought to have the money to go through this detox program.

29,alprazolam,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,"panic disorder, agoraphobia",helped me be able to leave the house for the first time in months quickly reduced my anxiety and i didnt have any attacks,Barely any despite some slight confusion.,"This medication (and other benzodiazepines) has gotten a bad reputation because some irresponsible people have ruined it for those that actually need it. If people would take this drug as prescribed, there would not be as many problems and it wouldn't carry the stigma it does now.

I started having panic attacks when I turned 21, and the condition soon worsened into full-blown panic disorder. A year later, I couldn't hold down a job and was agoraphobic. I tried counseling and medications like Zoloft and Lexapro. The side effects from those made me feel worse than I did just not taking them.

Finally my doctor decided to put me on Alprazolam as-needed. 

It has been a life-saver for me. I would take the lowest dose (0.25 mg), and be able to leave my house for the first time in months. I visited friends, went to restaurants, and did everything I used to do before my disorder. I finally felt like I had my life back. I would take one whenever I anticipated a situation where I could have an attack, or when I felt one coming on already. Sometimes I didn't even need all of the 0.25 mg and could break it in half. 

Too many people abuse this medication by upping their dosage without a doctor's consent or using it when they don't need to, and now you are almost treated like a criminal at some pharmacies and doctor's offices when they learn you are taking it because they think you are a druggie.

I *much* prefer this medication over any of the SSRIs, which have horrible side effects. I felt like a zombie on those medications, had no sex drive at all, and didn't have any energy whatsoever. The doctors tell you those side effects will go away with use, but for days to even weeks you feel 10 times worse than you did before. It's just not worth it.

0.25 mg of Alprazolam as-needed for anxiety has helped me get my life back on track and really helped save me from spending days and nights locked away in my house. I highly recommend this medication for responsible people who just need something in a crutch and don't want to go on long-term SSRIs that leave you feeling drained and lifeless.

Yes, counseling and therapy are a better alternative to medication, but the problem is always finding a *good* counselor, and sometimes even then, they just don't work. I have seen 3 counselors and all of them have failed to help me with anything, all I did was waste a $20 copay each visit to have them tell me things that sounded like they came from an inspirational booklet.

The worst side effect was the cost. I have no health insurance and wellbutrin xl is very expensive. I did not notice weight loss, as some others have, nor did I ever notice an increase in my libido. I tolerated it very well.","I started to take wellbutrin xl at about six months of pregnancy and continued for approx six months, when the baby was about three months old. I usually took it in the morning, but often times forgot and took it later in the day. None of this seemed to affect how well it worked. Were it not for the fact that it is so expensive and that it can be toxic to the body, I would take it every day.

137,valtrex,7,Moderately Effective,Mild Side Effects,cold sores,it definitely reduced the size and severity of the cold sore but now i get the more frequently  like twice a month,ocassional diarrhea and headache.,"I began getting cold sores about 5 years ago, when I was 35.  I would get them 3-4 times per year, especially when the weather changed.  My doctor prescribed me a 1mg tablet to take 2 of them in the morning and 2 at night at the onset of a cold sore.  It helped but the sore still ran its ugly course, even if I caught it right at the tingling point before it came out.  When I was 38, I went on birth control.  After about a year of being on Yaz, I began getting cold sores EVERY MONTH!  I told my doctor but she didn't think it was from the birth control - even though I read that BC suppresses your immune system, and anything that does that can allow for more instances of cold sores.  I went off the Yaz for 2 months, and STILL got cold sores during those two months.  So maybe she was right.  She then prescribed Valtrez 500mg once per day and I've been taking that since 9/09.  Still, like clockwork I get a cold sore every single month.  Either right before during or after my period.  So I think it's hormonal.  something is triggering them every month.  I've changed my diet completely, I take 4,000mg of Lsyine each day, I've tried the Red Marine Algae also.  No difference.  I'm a high stress personality anyway which doesn't help.  My doctor prescribed a mild sedative just to take the edge off and it does work great.  But still, the cold sores come like clockwork.  I just don't get it.  I'm starting a new job soon where I'll actually have to go to an office each day.  for the last 10 years I've been a road warrior, so I've been able to get around having to see people by making my own hours, especially if a cold sore errupts.  Now I don't know what I'll do.  It scares me and I'm stressed over that as well which doesn't help.  I feel plagued!  I don't know what else to try.  Maybe Acyclovir?",1

I felt ""high"" for many hours after taking this drug.","The plan was a permanent solution to my occasional flare-ups of sciatica.  My physician basically stated that there was no cure for my pain; therefore, I needed to be placed on a prescription regimen that would hopefully reduce the occurrence and/or frequency of sciatica.  Each bottle contained a 60 day supply with enough refills to last me an entire year.  I have 2 herniated discs, one at L4-L5 and the other at S1.  The herniation at L4-L5 was causing pressure on my sciatic nerve which runs down the length of the left leg.  For me, this drug was not effective; perhaps, if I had continual pain I would learn to live with the side-effects.  I did stop taking any medications for my condition and am learning to cope without prescriptions at this time.

I did take just the Clonozapm and Lovastatin the first year.   Regardless, everytime I looked up a symptom on the web, it always pointed to MS.  My Neurologist did say we should investigate it, but we never did.  Anyway, I could not sleep for days on end, I had excessive hand tremors, voice tremors, unsteady gait, tintinnitus, eyesight problems, urinary problems, memory problems and a bunch more I can't even recall at the moment.  I weaned myself off the medicine in 3 months time and am very much improved but only after months and possibly years of being removed from all the problems.  I'd like to mention that at one point in time I took the cholesterol drug that Dr. Jarvis promotes...I can't remember the name and had to quit within the first week as it gave me pains in the front of my thighs that could take your breath away.  I know for a fact that that symptom was in fact attributable to that drug.  A good effect that came from that drug though was the almost immediate shrinkage of my breast cysts...I had many on both sides.  Upon starting on that drug, I could actually feel them draining, dissapating or whatever you might call it.  They have not returned, so I am very thankful for that aspect of the drug.  Because of the leg pain though, I found it intolerable.","I am not sure what you mean as I already told you that I was being treated for TIA like seizures with the Clonozapam and Aggrenox as a blood thinner for the same.  I also took Lovastatin for High Cholesterol.  In the course of all these medications I ended up getting a divorce.  The drugs did not lower my cholesterol... they made me more nervous and made me question what on earth was wrong with me?  I now weigh more than I ever have, and I started to gain wieght almost immediately after getting off of the drugs.  I could use to lose 20lbs, but I am not worried about it as I am so much healthier than I was during the time I was on all of the drugs.  I hope this has helped you in some way.  I am sorry that I can't be more specific, but I am in a hurry to put all of that behind me and build a healthier - drug free future.  I am very much a proponent of natural medicines these days!",0

Not a joke.  But I have never had any abnormal urges to gamble while taking it.  I am not a gambling person. In fact the medication has never made me want to do anything wrong or strange and I've never had trouble or side effects at all unless I suddenly stop taking it and then I can't sit still or sleep becuase I am jumping around.,I take a .25mg tablet every a.m. and then around dinner I take another one.

661,suboxone,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,opioid addiction,"suboxone is beneficial for two reasons

 it eliminated the opiate withdrawal when i was kicking my original drug of choice

 as a maintenance drug suboxone eliminates the cravings that i would normally have for opioids as well as blocks the effects of agonist opioids heroin oxycodone etc so that there is no temptation to take these drugs

instead of struggling every day to avoid taking opioid drugs and all of the terrible thing that come with being in active addiction i can take suboxone and move on with life 

suboxone may have quite literally saved my life","My only major complaint is that since Suboxone is an opioid (though different from Heroin, Oxy, etc.) it causes constipation. 

Due to Suboxone's opioid blocking effect, if pain medication were needed in a hospital emergency setting, there could be complications. If I came in to the ER with a broken arm and they gave me a shot of Morphine, it would do absolutely nothing. Though this hasn't been an issue for me yet.","I am a drug addict, and although I went to rehab to get off of opiate drugs I just couldn't seem to stop. So I went on Suboxone, which is a new alternative to Methadone treatment.

While Methadone is a normal agonist opioid ('agonist' means it gets use high) it can be dispensed to drug addicts to keep them from withdrawing from their drug of choice because the Methadone lasts so long. But Methadone must be taken every day at a clinic and cannot be taken home, addicts can STILL use drugs while on Methadone if they choose too, it is EXTREMELY difficult to get off of, and Methadone still gets users high.

Suboxone is a great alternative because it can be prescribed and bought at the pharmacy so you can take it at home, it takes care of your drug cravings but it doesn't get you high (not exactly, anyways, but it does satisfy the Opiate Receptors enough) and it's really not all THAT hard to get off of if you must (the withdrawals are are VERY manageable).",1

Even waking up in the morning, the slight tightness I have then, Ventolin does nothing for. My girlfriend doesn't understand why I wheeze before AND AFTER I use the Ventolin.

Estrogen by mouth had more side effects, so I went on the patch, which I have to change only once a week. The recommended accompanying treatment of progesterone caused more problems than the estrogen: a combination patch which is available is more convenient, but I found by trying it that progesterone really aggravates my IBS symptoms.

In retrospect, I think that for me, the Sulindac was a trade-off: less stomach irritation exchanged for liver irritation with the Sulindac.  Due to this side-effect, my doctor reduced frequency of medication to once per day.

1067,botox,5,Highly Effective,Severe Side Effects,for wrinkle (line) reduction,botox was administered to help reduce the lines appearing on my forehead and at the outer side of my eyes crows feet  the  and  unit injections were effective in reducing the lines for a period of about  months but there were noticeable adverse reactions with the  units  the  units were as effective but without the spasms noted under treatment details  of the  times  units were injected  the last time the botox had been reconstituted for more than the recommended  hours  there was concern of effectiveness but actually it seems as though the botox was more quickly effective and seemed more effective in reducing the lines that the previous  unit injection  more detail is covered under the treatment details,"Side effects were twitching of eyes, especially upon smiling,,, spasms of cheeks.  Blurry vision.  This lasted for approximately 3 days.","The first use of botox was 100 units. Injections were 5 injections on the upper-mid forehead. 3 injections were given around the outer side of each eye. Within 2 hours it was difficult to close my eyes.  The forehead was totally stiff. Upon smiling and talking my cheek muscles were noticably twitching.  Eye lids twitched, friends noticed my face spasming.
   I make note of this issue because of the fact concerning the stability of the botox.  I realize that botox is available in 50 or 100 unit vials, which are then reconstituted. The nurse stated that he had to use all of the botox (apparently he only had the 100unit vial)because it would be instable after 4 hours.    
   Since this time, I have had 50units of botox at two different times, injected in the same areas stated above.  There was no adverse spasms, be definite ""freezing"" of the forehead muscles.  The 100 units and 50 units lasted about 4-5 months before lines started to appear again due to frowning, smiling, etc.   I recently had only 10 units injected mid-upper forehead in 2-3 injections. Upon raising my eyebrows I needed (I thought) injections more lower mid section since the upper forehead did not move.  After one month, I find that I have a few lines above my eyebrow but in general, my forehead is less lined.
  My MAIN CONCERN is :  if physicians, agents  have only 50 - 100unit vials available, and they are only injecting 1 client, what do they do with the residual.  Is this why there is such a high cost  $11 - $15 per unit??  It makes me wonder if physicians are freezing or using the botox beyond the 4 hour expiration time.  Have manufacturers ever thought of packaging smaller unit packages to assure clients are getting ""the real"" stuff.  This last physician did not have the manufacturer's bottle for me to see, only a small syringe already pre-filled.",1

657,seasonique,1,Ineffective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,have not stop bleeding,none,Bleeding not even Spotting,"Ladies: I am sure you may have done lots of researches by now regarding taking Seasonique (PLEASE do before you try to take this drug), and there are lots of negative than positive comments on this drug. I would like to point out a couple of my comments to share with you. I normally have 4 - 5 days menstrual periods every month. But I was not happy and tried to be on this drug because it described 4 periods only per year (WOW! what a great idea, especially I have small child, school, work, and husband). Guess what happen since then? I have been bleeding almost 2 weeks now, and from light to heavy, the worst part is I get all these uncomfortable cramps, keep waking up at night, my personalities change from good to bad, I have not been in a good mood since then. of course not, how can I be in a good mood when my vagina keeps bleeding on me every single day (I am sure no woman likes that), and so on. I spoke with my OB, and she said it's normal. I don't think so, it is completely not normal to me. I have been bleeding, and ruin my daily life style. No wonder it is called Birth Control. How can you have sex with your partner while you have all these symtomps in your body especially bleeding? I stop this drug, and can't wait to have my clean dates back.

Ladies: I am not saying all the women's body are the same. But if you want to be on this drug. I would advise you do more researches and read more comments before trying, and other advise is if you think it's a good idea for 4 periods per year, you may want to think twice. Because it's a mother nature for women that has 13 menstrual periods every year, trying to change it and playing with your hormones are the game, unless you like to gamble, then you may want to try this excitment drug, and hope you will win. Otherwise, please consider something else. I am so regret that I did not read all the comments and reviews before I asked my OB to put me on this drug. Therefore, I have to suffer what I deserve (I guess). I just don't want to see another woman to be suffered like me, as I finally found out there are lots of women out there are taking the same drug (before I made up my mind to throw this drug away) that are suffering the same symtomps but still want to continue and hopefully that will work one day. For me, ""no is no"". You can call me chicken or looser or whatsoever. But let me tell you, it is defintely not fun if the drug makes your life changes from okay to worse!

2985,strattera,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,add,greater focus stronger commitment lessened stress improved selfconfidence goal setting less depressed better organization and memory as in remembering events clearer in thought and expression thereof,"Lower regard for self-value, naturally depressive concepts seem less far-fetched, appear less happy.","With or without this medication I am a philosopher. So I will be explain how the drug works on me from a philosophical assessment.

Background:
I had taken Strattera for three years (2005-2007) where it helped control ADD where I had difficulty doing so. It helped me focus, stay organized, manage relations, and most or all of the benefits I listed prior. I dropped the drug for 3 years so that I may learn how to control my ADD without the help of medication. During those three years I gained remarkable self control in overcoming ADD. However, I got to the point where I couldn't win over ADD, which was losing focus randomly. During college lectures that I found very intriguing I would often zone out/space out when I could not have been more interested in what was being professed. The frustration of this led me to conclude that medical assistance was the best choice.

On the drug:
I read and understand that the (generally) biggest con--side effect--to this drug is that there is some sort of depressive or suicidal figure involved. From an evaluative standpoint of myself, I've concluded that my desire for happiness is lowered from where it was prior to the drug. In other words, if I felt a need for a happiness at a 9th strength before, I now had the need for happiness at a 5th strength. Since happiness, to me and most I'd say, is the driving force for existence in life, a lessened desire for it would lead to two results. Lessened feeling for the needing to exist/live and feeling less depressed (because I now do not need to be happy as much as before).

Understand that this drug does not control me, I control this drug. I suggest that while you take the medication you assert a greater self-awareness. As you examine how it affects you, you can understand when you are thinking naturally or by the drug.",1

A consultation with an orthopedic doctor was scheduled with an MRI performed.  The MRI showed some swelling in the knee joint ligaments under the front of the knee cap.  No tears or spurs were visible, thus the diagnosis was possible early stage of arthritis and/or minor injury.  I felt the arthritis was not completely impossible but more likely that some possible injury was probable owing to my daily work activity but no exact injury could be documented.  After the week of celebrex usage, without any noticable relief, I chose to discontinue the medication route in favor of some time off (2 weeks) with ice-pack heat-pad therapy to reduce swelling and pain.

Soma is listed as a muscle relaxant which is quite misleading. Because it has been cleverly marketed, it is readily prescribed (or was) and very accessible. I think many pain management physicians prescribe soma for their patients without much thought as to the risks.  The major adverse affects is the rapid tolerance developement and short term memory loss.  There were a number of times that I'd forgotten if /or how much I had taken, which on one occasion precipitated an emergency room visit. It should be classified as a schedule 2 drug at least because of the potential for abuse and overdose. I think this drug should be taken off of the market.",There aren't any treatment details.

I had teeth sensitivety that developed after starting the drug, rapid pulse (this was weird but it was never a bother), I lost a few lbs and I could eat whatever and not gain much weight. My testosterone levels went way high - not high enough to turn into a boy, but high enough to grow more body hair in places I didn't want and had some hair loss at the temples. I also had problems with short term memory, though I did before when I was in a fibro-fog too. So off the medicine I have a heck of a time still because it is back to fibro fog.

If I didn't have a busy job it would just be ideal to try to get closer to 8 or more hrs of sleep every night. That was not always practical for me. I started off at the 3 gms dose twice per night and never had to change. Sometimes, depending on the time of month I got less sleep with the dose - i would awake after only 2.5 hrs later and get around 5 hrs of sleep a night. Depending on where it was with my cycle, sometimes I couldn't wake up so I would lessen my second dose to 2.25 gms so I could wake up at 4 hrs after the dose.",1

Graying of the teeth, especially lower teeth, bluish at roots. Lethargy, lack of concentration.","My acne/ rosacea began at age 14, and was treated only topically with harsh over the counter products, with poor result. I began taking high doses of Tetracyclean at age 20. By age 30 I was also adding clindamycin topical solution to help control or dry out the breakouts. Even so, this combined effort was only mildly effective. I never drank alcohol, caffeine, and avoided spicy food while drinking lots of water and having a healthy lifestyle. By age 38, I was introduced to Minocyclean which was immediately effective and controlled my acne/ rosacea. Within 4-5 years, my teeth began to grey, weight gain began, and severe bruising developed on my upper and lower legs. Two weeks ago I phased out of the Minocycline and adopted a strong Probiotic ( 15 billion mc of acidophilus, etc. ) regimen with additional herbal supplement to treat yeast and parasites. I continue to use the topical Clindamycin, and so far the result is very controlled and manageable skin. I am monitoring my teeth and anxious to see if the bruising disappears before long. Antibiotics use create yeast in our bodies, which Acne and Rosacea thrive on. Rid yourself of the drugs, and use the natural supplements instead, and eliminate irritating triggers. Been on antibiotics for 24 years, and now excited to see something finally able to free my from those drugs. The supplement can be found on CandidaFreedom.

2278,lexapro,1,Ineffective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,clinical depression,the treatment benefits were very minimal because of the severe rage that i experienced i dont think i benefited at all from taking this drug,"This drug was very toxic to my system because it caused severe rage. I really was never relieved from my clinical depression because I kept hoping that the drug benefits would kick in and kept on taking it until one day I realized that I had to stop taking it. After about 2 months, I realized that I was very agitated constantly. I just thought that it would eventually go away but it never did. My nervousness was getting extreme. One day, I was in a grocery store shopping, pushing a grocery cart, and a little boy walked in front of me pushing a toy cart. I was so agitated that I had an INTENSE DESIRE to ram him with my shopping cart. I realized that this behavior was NOT ME and that the Lexapro was causing the severe rage. I also had a constant desire to start running down the street as fast as I could and NOT stop. I also couldn't sleep at night and if I was able to go to sleep finally, I would only stay asleep for a few hours. I sure hope this medication is taken off the market because it could cause some unstable patients to take other's lives from the severe rage.","This medication is manufactured by Forest Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a subsidiary of Forest Laboratories, Inc. in St. Louis Missouri 63045. I was given the prescription of taking 10 mg. once a day. I cannot even imagine what would have happened to me if I had taken the full dosage recommended of 20 mg. I would have probably hurt someone badly. I have always suffered from clinical depression and have taken many different medications. Right now, Paxil is helping me with my depression a little. I think that I need to have it ""upped"" because the usual dosage isn't as effective as it once was. Anyway, my psychiatrist prescribed Lexapro for me because he really believed that this new drug would be just perfect for me. I had no idea that it would cause such turmoil in my life. I was in a constant state of nervousness and my panic attacks had started to get much worse. I just thought that my daily routine was the cause for my anxiety but realized when I had the desire to shove my shopping cart into a little boy who walked in front of me in the store, as I stated before in this report, that I had to quit taking Lexapro. Sometimes, I would sit on my sofa at night and want so badly to just scream at the top of my lungs. My therapist just told me to take a pillow, put it over my face, and scream at the top of my lungs. I was afraid that my neighbors would call the police if they heard me. That was no way to live. This medication was so toxic to me that if I had not realized what it was doing to me, I might have even taken my own life. Because of my great faith in God, I didn't kill myself and finally realized that I had to call my doctor immediately the next morning to report what Lexapro was doing to me. I also have a friend who is taking Lexapro and has taken it for sometime. She also shows signs of rage at times. Just a minor infringement on her and she will go into a state of rage (but not as bad as I did). I have tried to tell her that she needs to get off Lexapro but she just thinks that OTHER people are intimidating her. One day, when she rams her car into someone elses because they pulled in front of her, she will finally realize that Lexapro is not the drug for HER either. I really do think that Lexapro should be taken off the market until further testing is done. I would NEVER recommend this drug to anyone. It is just too unstable.",0

This controlled by blood sugar but it is important to realize that the medication does not peak until about 4-6 hours after it is taken. This is important knowledge to have in order to time the administration of the drug. When I took it too close to dinner time, it was not as effective as when I took it 4-5 hours before dinner.

I also did not believe I was bi-polar when dignosed 12 years ago as an in-patient, because I had no understanding of mixed episodes and rapid cycling. I thought when I was hypo-manic, it was just a great relief and celebration of not being depressed. I was also not honest about my alcohol abuse until about 6 months ago, and have since stopped drinking, which allowed me to realize I was quelling the manis with alcohol, and with out it I was more unstable and manic.

It has nothing to do with my mental state but the fact that the drug does this to everyone. You have to let it build up in your system because your body is trying to reject a poison.

And nobody knew that I wasn't crazy. This damn drug was making me crazy. I told my stupid shrink that I needed to be calmer and he gave me speed. I told him I was getting irrationally upset and he doubled the dose. I have been seriously depressed and screwed up emotionally and physically for three years.  I want to sue the drug company.

3431,tazorac,9,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,"acne, photoaging",this is probably the best skin care productmedicine available it is highly effective for both acne and photoaging it exfoliates the skin better than anything else thus unclogging the pores it also speeds up cell turnover which reduces keratinization preventing comedoformation it smooths out wrinkles makes the deep layers of skin  dermis  thicker increases collagen production etc you can read about all its benefits on pubmed it has been proven more effective than tretinoin retin a for both acne and photoaging,"Initially it is quite irritating, that is why it is VERY important to start using it less often and with a smaller applied amount. Do not overdose on Tazorac or else your skin - the upper horny layer, statum corneum - will become so thin and dry that it will crack - thus you will actually CREATE wrinkles rather than eliminate any. If you take it slowly and gradually increase the dose, you won't have that problem, as the skin adjusts to it. You should probably start using it only every 3rd or 4th day initially, gradually increasing to every other day or even every day. Some people are able to use it twice a day; I know I cant. In case you develop severe irritation, you must use a good moisturizer to prevent wrinkle formation. If you are using it for acne, and are using other products such as benzoyl peroxide - as you should, you should be even more careful, as skin irritation is cumulative from the various drugs. You will have to use a lower dose BP such as 2.5% because your skin will be exfoliated and more easily irritated.","The gel is more effective than the cream, in that it delivers a higher dosage of the medication faster. The cream however has lower side effects and it achieves more controlled release of the drug. I believe the cream is more appropriate for anti-aging, as it is more emollient. Neither the cream nor the gel are comedogenic so acne sufferers should not worry. I have used both the gel and the cream, with both concentrations - .05% and .1%. I am currently using the .1% cream.

I did try one, and it was MUCH more heart-poundingly stimulating than albuterol.  Dangerous for someone with heart problems, but difficulty breathing would be dangerous as well.

At some point, I got a generic albuterol inhaler and found it much less effective than the Ventolin brand.  My doctor said that other patients had told her the same thing.

I rarely need it now, maybe only once every two years.  But I try to keep one with me at all times because when I need it, I really need it.  I take long walks down and up a hill and if I had an attack at the bottom of the hill I would be in trouble.

It is almost magic, though--one minute it takes a great exertion to breathe and I feel like I am suffocating--then I inhale Ventolin and my bronchial tubes open right up.  It is a lifesaver.

As a child and teenager I did not mind the slight ""rush,""  I even liked it.  Part of that rush may be caused by the deep exhalation and inhalation required to properly ingest the drug.",1

I have no feeling in my feet.  My right leg does not work correctly.  The Neurontin is mainly attributable to the quality of life that I have today.  Then the other medications I take all do their part.  The Nerontin blocks the pain nerve signal from registering in my brain.  The Methodone deals directly with the pain as does the Lidoderm Patch.  The muscle relaxer keeps my muscles from spontaneously contracting, which they will do without the medication.  The anti-depressents help me stay positive, which is where I want to be.  I usually have a sunny outlook and the medicine helps me keep it.  When my last medicine stopped working, I was depressed for a total of 6 months.  What a waste of time.",1

7. Bad experience for $200!!!","Hi! I am a russian (european race) who has migrated from Sweden to the USA. I have developed melasma (dark spots) under my eyes and on my forehead. I visited a dermatologist in the USA, FL about 1 month ago. He prescribed me Tri Luma that contains 4% of Hudroquinone. Have you ever read about Hydroquinone?- I asked him. As I investigated it I found the information that hydroquinone has been banned in many european countries including France, Sweden and Russia etc, for concerns about increased cancer risk.The FDA admitted that the risk of using the drug is not known and more testing needs to be done.In fact, the FDA also warned that hydroquinone has been linked to a condition that disfigures the skin. Anyway,I tried the cream, a sample that the doctor gave to me. He prescribed to use it twice a week - Mondays and Fridays. It was terrible!!! I used it just once a week on my pigment spots because my skin got red, burning and after 1 week it was peeling. Some doctors prescribe to use it once, twice a day!!! I put it on only once a week. Ok, after 1 month, 4 treatments I have the result: my pigment spots have not been improved at all. Moreover, the skin is burnt and now I have very obvious dark red-brown spots. I really look terrible. I can't put on any sunscreen because the skin is damaged by Tri Luma. I am so happy that I didn't buy the full size cream which costs $200 and the insurance doesn't cover it. I don't want to buy cancer for $200. Thanks. I've also contacted russian and swedish doctors. They've forbade to use it strongly!!! They've suggested to use natural products such as juice of lemon, parcley, put camomile teabags on dark spots, oatmeal etc... and of course, avoid the Sun.

I will do my best, and if you wish to email me with a request for specific info, I will be happy to help.  I was seeing a psychiatrist 9 years ago who thought Effexor was worth a try.  I had been on Prozac a few yrs previous, and although it worked really well, after taking it for two years I developed the side effect of experiencing arthritic pain in my hands.  That was the reason I discontinued the use of Prozac. After being off the Prozac or any other meds for a year or two, I could feel myself sliding back into the black hole of depression and severe anxiety.  I found a doctor (psychiatrist)and he put me on Effexor.  It was a miracle.  I was soooo happy to find something that worked so well, and on the first try. (Several years before, I had gone through what my family refers to as the ""year of hell,"" when I first began the journey of searching for an anti-depressant that would work AND not have side effects that kept me from functioning normally.) My treatment consisted of: Taking the 300 mg of effexor, and monthly visits to my psychiatrist to determine how well my effexor was working and to discuss other treatment options. Although I could notice a marked difference in my mood, I still felt that I wasn't nearly as healthy mentally as I needed to be.  I would still have days when I felt ""paralyzed"" and very anxious.  When I discussed the problem with my psych., he suggested that I add Luvox, another anti-depressant, to my regimen.  That helped as well, although there were two unpleasant side effects: 1) loss of sex drive and difficulty achieving orgasm, and 2) night sweats.  My doc prescribed 1 mg of hytrin for the night sweats; it worked, and he recommended 60 mg. ginko biloba daily for the loss of sex drive.  It may have helped a little, but I was never quite sure. One other thing I found beneficial for my anxiety was 10 mg. dexadrine.  It seemed contradictory to me that a stimulant would calm me down, but the very first day I took it, I felt calm for the first time in my life. Up until then I didn't realize how severe my anxiety was, because I had never known what it was like to be without it. But that very first day I took it, I felt a calmness come over me that was such a relief.  Always before, I had a feeling inside that I can only explain as the feeling one would get if one was late for an important meeting with one's boss.  Sort of like, ""I'm late! Gotta hurry! oh, no!""  That was a feeling that I had always had, and it had nothing to do with what my situation was-- late or early, it made no difference.  For the first two weeks I took the Dexadrine, I didn't pull my hair (trichotillomania)at all, nor did I even realize I wasn't pulling, as I didn't even think about it.  Unfortunately, I did go back to pulling after that. The 2 side effects I experienced with the dex. is that 1) it made me drowsy for about the first hour after I took it, and 2) it made me feel like I lost my spontaneity.  I got a lot more done, and I didn't feel so panicked, but I wasn't as much fun.  For that reason, I stopped taking it regularly and took it maybe only half of the time.  After maybe a year or two I quit taking it altogether and when I went back on it last year after having been off of it for about 5 years, it no longer worked as it had before.  It made me feel jittery as though I'd had way too much coffee.  It just made the anxiety worse.

I'm not sure if I was supposed to tell about more than one medication for this survey. However, these four meds I've mentioned were all sort of intertwined, so it seemed appropriate for me to do so.

When my face is clean and dry, I apply a pea-sized amount of Retin-A gel all over my face and neck.  I do not avoid the eye area, but I do wash the gel off my eyebrows with a q-tip and water so that the skin under my eyebrows doesn't peel.  I also put Talika Lipocils on my eyelashes.  
In the morning I wash my face, exfoliating every couple of days to rid the skin surface of drying flakes.  Then I moisturize with shea butter or almond oil or even extra-virgin olive oil.  This does not make my face oily; my skin drinks up the oil and looks good.  
The following night I wash my face and when it is clean and dry, I apply Stri-Vectin.  I alternate so that one night I use Retin-A and the next night I use Stri-Vectin or another moisturizer.  I don't think I will be buying any more Stri-Vectin because I am doubtful of its effectiveness and because I would prefer to make my own product.  I know that I will be unable to make Retin-A gel, but making other products for my own use is very attractive to me.",1

The side effects while taking it were just fine with me, though my psychiatrist seemed alarmed about my heart rate and blood pressure. That said, the withdrawal was so atrociously horrible it simply wasn't worth taking. I would have rather taken a drug that was half as effective without this uniquely gross withdrawal. Let me put this into perspective: I've gone through nicotine, alcohol, and speed withdrawal (the last a long time ago) and the Effexor was the worst (and I required hospitalization for the alcohol). It took me between three and four months to taper off the drug. I tried to stop --unsuccessfully--at 75% the regular dose, then 50%, and then 25% before deciding to just taper it down to a dose so small I had a hard time believing it had any psychoactive effects at all. Even finally quitting taking the drug at all when I'd tapered down to 1/15th the initial dose, I experienced mild versions of the same awful withdrawal issues that had popped up before: intermittent (intense!) nausea (previously full blown vomiting on previous quitting attempts), night sweats, what I've read in Effexor forums described-inadequately-as ""brain shivers,"" though-- amusingly enough-- very little of the depression or anxiety rebound past the first few days of 0 mg.

The patient had been on welbutrin for years for depression and smoking cessation.  The psychiatrist kept the patient on welbutrin and added xanax for anxiety and seroquel for sleep at bedtime.  Slowly the family started noticing strange behavior, delusions, and almost dementia type characteristics in the patient that occured over a 4 month period and began to get more severe.  The family attempted to talk about the changes with the patient but as true delusional behavior dictates, the patient was unable to see any of the changes.  The forgetfulness, clumsiness, and personality changes such as irritability increased.  The family attempted to contact the psychiatrist but in interim, the patient died of a cardiac arrest.  Even after talking to the psychiatrist after the patient's death, the psychiatrist denied that seroquel had any affect on the situation.  The family and myself as the primary caretaker believe that seroquel was directly responsible for the patient's death.

Found it nearly impossible to drag myself out of bed in am.  My morphine controlled release wears off within 8-9 hours, so staying in bed NOT advisable without another dose of morphine or Percocet, but the neurontin makes me want to keep sleeping.  When I finally do wake up, minimally after 11 hours after I fell asleep, I still felt tired, and now in a lot of back, hip and sometimes even knee pain, from laying in bed motionless for so long, on L side of body.  Because of the sleepiness side effect, I do not take any during day. Since my MD would not lower dosage from 300mg until next monthly visit, I bought empty size 0 gel capsules at local health food store, and painstakingly divided the dosage from the 300mg capsules into 2 150mg capsules.  Initially, this seemed to be a good solution.  I was able to continue having 8h of pain-free sleep, and getting up after 8h was easier.   But, after only 4 days at the lower 150mg dosage, the excessive sleepiness after 8h of normal sleep continued, so I need to try cutting down the dosage even more.  Have to take the dextroamphetamine controlled release, to fully wake me up in AM, and once that wore off after 12 hours in early evening, I am too tired to study for my classes.  Overall, I would recommend this drug only for adults who do not have to drive to work, or adults who can take naps during work hours, or adults who are not trying to taking classes for credit.

After a few days I was still getting worse and did feel  minimal comfort from the puffer, and my overall infection was getting worse. I went back to the doctor and they added in a Ventolin puffer to open the airways 2 puffs 4 times per day in between the symbicort. 5 days later I went back to the doctor wheezing more and with a sort of stuffy nose and serious nasal pain (mostly from coughing so much. He told me I caught a sinus infection since the steroid lowers your emmmune system and makes it easier to catch another infection. He then prescribed me to 50 mg of Prednisone each day for a 3 day term so that it could tackle the inflammation fast so that the cortisone puffer would be able to catch up ( it couldn't work fast enough as it takes a while to start working) and also prescribed me to Amoxicillin for the sinus infection (since it was caused by bacteria) He said he would have prescribed me the antibiotic even if i didn't catch the sinus infection as an immune booster since prednisone lowers your immune system.. I took my first prednisone yesterday for the first time, it made me feel good for 9 hours or so but gave me some joint pain. The next day I felt a little better but still coughing and sick until I took the Prednisone again.

I think tomorrow I will feel a little better, great again when I am on the Prednisone, and hopefully after that the puffer will Finnish off fixing the inflammation. Did anyone get hearing loss when taking prednisone? Its like when your on an airplane and your ears need to be popped but you cant pop them. I checked online and all I could find is prednisone fixes hearing loss..haha.. weird anyways.. Overall I think it works great!",1

2065,warfarin,6,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,heart condition,"taking  mg of warfarin sufficiently thinned my blood so that i did not find it difficult to do everyday tasks  i immediately felt better after i started the regimen in the spring of   my cough went away and i had a lot more energy
i took this regimen for about  years everyday  i also found it easier to concentrate and think what was i doing before it  it was as if my brain cleared up or something  i breathed easier and i was more willing to tackle regular household chores  i worked over  hoursweek before and during this treatment","The side effects of warfarin on me did not become apparent until a couple of years later.  I started feeling weak and I bruised easily.  I acquired more broken blood vessels/capillaries veins in my feet and calves.  I was tired and started feeling cranky.  I stopped taking warfarin for 6 months but then went back to it after I had the old feeling of ""thick"" blood.  During the 6 months that I wasn't taking warfarin, I felt better, had more energy.  But then the downside: my blood was getting too thick and I was starting to get headaches.  So I went back on it.  This time my doctor said I might have to increase dosage to 4 mg. since I hadn't been taking the warfarin.  However, when I had my thrombin checked, I was okay at 3 mg.; I took this for another 3 months and then started feeling the old way and quit again.  The same scenario was repeated (started feeling like I had ""thick"" blood and now I had increasingly bad headaches).  I went back on 3 mg. of warfarin in August of this year but only took them for 3 months. Then I started a vitamin/mineral/COQ10 regimen and stuck with it and am still doing that.  I credit most of the perfect blood feeling (for lack of a better term) to Vitamin E and the fact that I also changed my diet.  I try to eat a lot of veggies and fruits, and I have been a vegetarian for almost two years (not super strict - but I feel disgusted about eating meat and therefore never eat it unless it is buried in some food.  I do eat salmon and tuna.  The final straw for me with warfarin was that I started feeling really mad about things.  The littlest things would make me angry, anger that was way out of proportion to the incident.   When my teenaged daughter started crying after I ripped into her for staying longer at a social visit, and I heard my words echoing in my house, I knew that was it.  I quit warfarin and started taking 81 mg. of aspirin daily (I had a headache every morning after I went off warfarin).  I started the vit./min. regimen in November, gradually adding supplements as I learned about their benefits, but it wasn't until 3-4 weeks ago that I realized I wasn't having any headaches and I was able to stop taking 81 mg. of aspirin. Also, since starting the stricter diet and the vit./min. supplements (also some herbs), I have not had an anger ""fit"" (of course, I am also more prone to control my anger because I really didn't like how I had been), I do not feel depressed.  I have told everyone in my family about this because it seems so remarkable.  Why didn't the doctors tell me?","Treatment consisted of simply taking 3 mg. of warfarin daily and getting my blood thrombin checked every two months.  I was not a very good patient about getting my blood thr. checked so I'm sure when I was feeling weak and bruised/bled so easily, my blood was getting too thin.  And then when I would quit the warfarin for several weeks, sometimes months at a time, my blood would get too thick.  I really like my doctor though, because he tells me to do what makes me feel best, and I think that's smart advice.  I must say add that I always loved the feeling of donating blood before I took warfarin because it gave me the same feeling as I initially had with warfarin (at the very beginning of my treatment).  I would like to donate blood now but they don't let me because I don't weigh enough (which makes no sense at all).  Couldn't they take less blood?  Who determined how much blood you can give anyway?",1

My depression took the form of a lack of interest in all aspects of my life and I had begun to ""shut down"" to such a degree that sometimes the act of just walking from the garage into my house required a strong act of will. When I had to run errands, like grocery shopping, I felt an uncomfortable detachment from my environment.

I took one 70mg pill in the morning.  The pill releases the drug slowly, so ur not hit with all of it at one time.  This allows for the medicine to be equally effective all day, not just for a few hours. I did NOT have any of the normal ADHD med. side effects, such as: rapid heart rate, anxiety, jittery feeling.  The only downside to this medication is the cost.  Since Vyvanse is new, there is no generic for it.  I paid $160/month for 30 pills!

Estrogen by mouth had more side effects, so I went on the patch, which I have to change only once a week. The recommended accompanying treatment of progesterone caused more problems than the estrogen: a combination patch which is available is more convenient, but I found by trying it that progesterone really aggravates my IBS symptoms. To lessen that effect, I went on an estrogen-only patch and use a separate progesterone only 7 days/month.

thanks to the medication i was able to reorganize my life and focus on moving ahead instead of being stuck knowing what things needed to be done but not having the drive or motivation to do them","The sexual side effects ultimately led me stop taking the Zoloft. My husband and I found it very frustrating that I was unable to reach climax where before, I had been multi-orgasmic. Because our sex life is very important to us, this became an area of contention that I found to be unacceptable.  My inability to reach orgasm was demoralizing for my husband feeling he could no longer please me and for me the frustration of it all made sex seem like too much work to bother with. My libido came to a screeching halt. This depressed both of us so I gradually weaned myself off the Zoloft and shortly thereafter, became pregnant with our first child. 

One other thing about taking the Zoloft was that after the elevated mood from the initial breakthrough of depression wore off; I found myself living life somewhere in the middle. In addition to the lows no longer being depressingly low, the highs were not as uplifting as before. I was, in essence, comfortably numb.

Other side effects were dry mouth, nausea, weight gain, and increased irritability. , although the later could have been due to the stress of our temporary living conditions.","My primary care physician prescribed counseling and the antidepressant, Zoloft.

I started with 25 mg every other day for five days, then 25 mg a day for one week, followed by 50 mg a day every day thereafter. I began therapy with a psychologist once a week where I was diagnosed with PTSD. Strangely enough, I found the counseling to do more harm than good in this case partially because it made me see my childhood for what it really was. I did not find that to be helpful at the time. Had I not been on anti-depressants before I went to counseling, I would have needed it afterward to deal with the emotional blows that I had to face and could no longer ignore that drove me into depression in the first place.",1

increased mobility activity level due to experiencing less pain
 sleep  was able to sleep longer while the medication was still active
 better mood because of less pain","The level of pain control quickly decreased (with the prescribed amount of medication(10 mg)) resulting in having to steadily increase the dosage for the same amount of pain relief. However the worst side effects were severe constipation(even while taking stool softeners/extra fiber, water, etc), depression, insomnia, weight loss, hair loss, muscle wasting, my skin became completely dehydrated and wrinkled. Became physically and mentally addicted to the medication, when I tried to reduce the dosage /stop taking the medication I experienced severe withdrawal symptoms (fever,chills, nausea, vomiting, severe bone muscle and joint pain) to name a few.","I was in an MVA in 2002 in which I suffered a whiplash type injury which caused/accelerated the DDD. I was prescribed Percocette 5mg on an as needed basis for pain control. After 3 years (of constant agonizing pain)of being on the Percocette they became ineffective at relieving pain and I was referred to a PAIN CLINIC specializing in chronic pain. The doctors there decided that I had built up a tolerance/dependence on the Percocette and that it would be best to put me on a longer acting narcotic (Oxycontin 10mg,time released, supposed to provide pain relief for 12 hrs) with Percocette (Oxycodone 5mg/Acetaminophen 325 mg)for break through pain. In the beginning the medication seemed to help but over time I built up a tolerance to the Oxycodone(they became less effective) which meant I had to keep increasing the dosage to get the same amount of pain relief. For example I started out with Oxycontin 10mg/3x day and approx 3 Percocette/daily a couple of months later as my tolerance increased I had to take Oxycontin 20mg/3X day and 5-6 Percocette as the months passed by my tolerance grew and my dosage was increased. After about 8 months on the Oxycontin I started to experience all of the side effects mentioned above, not only did I notice the negative effects the drug was having on me but friends and family noticed too, and mentioned (not to me but amongst themselves) that my appearance/demeanor over the past 2 yrs had dramatically changed. A couple of months ago my Sister took me aside and asked me what was wrong to which I replied nothing why? She then explained to me how my behavior(depression, moodiness, etc.) and appearance(drastic weight loss) had been getting worse and worse and told me that she was worried. Being under the influence of these drugs for so long I felt like I was in a fog and really had no idea as to the extent of how bad it really was/ how I looked. So I stepped back and examined the last 4-5 yrs of my life while on these medications and realized that they had taken a considerable toll on me emotionally, physically, mentally. I strongly advise that before anyone decides to go this route for pain management that you have a long talk with your Physician on the pros and cons of this medication specifically the Oxycontin. If I would have known then what I know now about all the negative side effects I would never, never had started taking it. I feel that it deteriorated my body (especially my muscle mass and skin). When I started taking the medication I was 37 and felt 25 and was told I looked like I was in my late 20's, I am now 42, I feel 50 and now in an effort to spare my feelings people don't mention anything about how old I look . I wish that my Physicians would have told me about ALL of the negative effects of this medication instead of just the positive (which are few). In my opinion the negative far outweigh the positive. I'm still in constant pain but will continue to search for pain management without drugs. PLEASE USE WITH CAUTION!",0

I intend to try gabapentin now, although some people have referred to it as the 'zombie drug'. My main reason for not upping the Nortrip back to 25mg, is that I want to see if I will be able to have an orgasm on the Gaba- although maybe this is a luxury- as anyone with nerve pain knows, sex is the last thing on your mind when you are in such pain.

On completion, my dermatologist told me he has prescribed it for 10 years and has never once had a case of depression and only 2 people have had bad blood tests.

I would have compulsive sexual desires that I had never had before and wanted sex with my husband all the time.  I had great difficulty sleeping so I would take melatonin to go to sleep every night.  I would talk very fast as well as move fast.  I would have hand tremers.  I also had very dry mouth and diarrhea.,"I woke up every morning a took 1 20mg tab with a full glass of water.

However, I do consume a fairly high amount of caffeine during the day and I was told to expect this by my doctor.  Another effect that I didn't really connect to the medication was a lack of motivation.  I did not attribute this specifically to the medication until I had a conversation with my best friend who had also taken Wellbutrin at one point.  She asked me specifically if I had experienced diminshed motivation while on the drug and it ""clicked"" with me.  I am not entirely certain if this can be attributed solely to the medication since this is also a symptom of depression.","Overall, I feel that my treatment with this drug has been successful.  I have not experienced any sexual side effects (which I know can occur with some antidepressants).  My libido is exactly the same as it was before my depression and before I began taking this drug.  I know that this drug can also cause a decrease in appetite as well as the urge to smoke.  My husband and I both smoke and I do smoke less when he is not home.  He is not on any medications and so he will frequently ask me if I want to go outside with him and smoke.  Usually (not always) I say yes for the companionship but sometimes I decline.  When he is not home I will smoke approximately 4 cigarettes in an 8-9 hour period (I used to be a pack-a-day smoker).  
Overall, I feel that this is a useful drug for depression.  I began taking it after my father died.  He battled cancer for 3 years and I took care of him the entire time.  His loss was debilitating to me.  No pill is going to change what I went through or how I feel, but this drug has helped me explore some of the painful feelings that go along with his death without ""coming unglued"".  My doctor prescribed this for me and at the same time switched me from Ortho-Tricyclen (which I was highly loyal to) to Loestrin Fe 24.  I must say that between these two drugs, physically I feel ten years younger (I am 33 but I feel 23 again).

I am normally a very active person who enjoys exercising daily. While on Lexapro, I found myself preferring to just relax and watch televison (did cause slight weight gain due to this). More serious and traumatizing side effects was the sudden onset of severe chest pain, rapid heartbeat, dizzy spells, sweating, fatigue, numbness in legs and nausea. The first episode occurred one day at work causing an ambulance to be dispatched to job. From that day on, these attacks happened quite frequently, my doctor took me off the medicine. However, these attacks continued to occur for over a year later (never happened to me before Lexapro). In fact, these effects started a two year long string of attacks, visits to cardiologists, emergency rooms, my fear of exercising as increased activity seemed to affect my heart and induce rapid heart beat. I began to fear driving as my dizzy spells would occur for no apparent reason, as well as the numbness in my legs. No doctor was much help, in fact I often got treated as if I was crazy and was just told that I am suffering from panic attacks. I understand that panic attacks can occur out of nowhere in ones life and once you have them you may experience continued anxiety. I believe the Lexapro opened this pandoras box for me though.

3677,effexor-xr,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,"anxiety, mild depression",venlafaxine is a bicyclic antidepressant and is usually categorized as a serotoninnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitor snri but it has been referred to as a serotoninnorepinephrinedopamine reuptake inhibitor it works by blocking the transporter reuptake proteins for key neurotransmitters affecting mood thereby leaving more active neurotransmitters in the synapse the neurotransmitters affected are serotonin hydroxytryptamine and norepinephrine noradrenaline additionally in high doses it weakly inhibits the reuptake of dopamine with recent evidence showing that the norepinephrine transporter also transports some dopamine as well implying that snris may also increase dopamine transmission this is because snris work by inhibiting reuptake ie preventing the serotonin and norepinephrine transporters from taking their respective neurotransmitters back to their storage vesicles for later use if the norepinephrine transporter normally recycles some dopamine too then snris will also enhance dopaminergic transmission therefore the antidepressant effects associated with increasing norepinephrine levels may also be partly or largely due to the concurrent increase in dopamine particularly in the prefrontal cortex,Difficulty in reaching orgasm.

I don't know if it's just because of the methadone slowing your metabolism, or if it is caused by the need to eat sweets but I have gained at least 90 lbs since starting methadone 7 years ago.

Unfortunately no matter when I took it my sleep was also assisted while in my car or at my desk at work! This decreased over time but was still in certain circumstances a danger. I will say however, it did decrease my migraines--the greater my neurontin dose the less my migraines. But I opted to take my migraines over falling asleep driving, possibly killing others or myself.

I didn't realize it was a side effect until reading about it later.  A few bad dreams was well worth the results.,"You take 1/2 dose pills for maybe a week in the starter pack.  Then move to full strength.  Take 1 in the morning and one in the evening or late day.  Try to establish a ""quit"" day before starting.  I didn't.  I used it for 2-3 weeks while I tapered down and worked on the psychological aspects.  After 2 days of only having 1 cig a day, I stopped.  After 4 months, my insurance no longer paid.  I needed longer and paid full price.  I used my last box PRN.  When I'd be in an evening situation where I thought it might be difficult, I'd take one a few hours before going and it would work.  Taking only 1 in the daytime did NOT result in the bad dreams.  I ended up with a few pills left over.

I went into a severe depression in which I was either very angry, very sad or just felt numb. I cycled between those feelings. Nothing brought me pleasure, the things that used to love to do like dancing or  going out with friends, did nothing for me.  I didn't care to do them. I thought I was going crazy. I was like this for about 4 months before I started feeling a little better and maybe about 6-7 months before I felt like myself again.  

I still get occasional cravings but the thought of going through that again keeps me away.  I consider it to be effective but would recommend joining a support group or going to a counselor to help cope with the mood swings.  If you don't have someone you see on a daily basis that can point out those changes I would highly recommend the latter.  I didn't realize that i had fallen into a depression until months into it.",1

I have been taking it for sometime now and do not remember any other side effects from this mediation.,I started off taking 50mg for two weeks then increased the dosage to 75mg for two weeks.

Even though I am very opioid-tolerant, it was still sedating for me.  In addition to causing drowsiness and fatigue, it tends to be highly habit-forming.  Because of the strength and nature of the drug, the human body becomes physically dependent on it, which has a few implications.  First, it loses efficacy over time, meaning you need to keep increasing the dosage over time to maintain the same effectiveness. The other issue with physical dependence is withdrawal.  I had severe physical withdrawal symptoms if I waited too long to change the patch (starting a day or so after I was scheduled to change it and becoming more and more severe with time.)  Several specialists I saw actually recommended hospitalization for controlled dose reduction as the safest way to stop taking fentanyl patches because they cause such severe physical withdrawal symptoms.  I withdrew from it completely 3 times, and suffered severe, debilitating symptoms for the first couple of weeks each time with decreasingly severe symptoms lasting for over a month after I stopped using it.  Although I have never had an issue with psychological dependence on any drug, I think it is important to mention that this one can be very addictive (meaning that those who take it frequently develop a psychological dependence, especially if the user is prone to substance abuse.)","I took Duragesic as a long-term maintenance medication on several different occasions, but it can be taken permanently as long as it remains effective.",1

Doctors were baffled as to why I'd ended up with such dry eyes at such a young age, said they weren't sure what caused it but said it normally happens to menopausal or elderly women (I was 20-21 at the time). Now looking back I realise that the dry eyes match with a lot of the other symptoms I was experiencing at the time, many of which are normally symptoms of the menopause/ageing. Considering these symptoms have now either completely disappeared or improved since stopping the use of hormonal birth control methods (I now use the copper IUD), I believe they may well have been linked Yasmin.

Then I started to have choking fits. They were becoming so serious that I feared choking to death. I suspected Advair, so I tried not taking it and then taking it again. The cause was identified and I stopped taking Advair. The choking fits ceased. The fatigue, anxiety, and panic attacks were found to be a malfunciton of my adrenal gland (confimed by lab tests). The chronic bronchitis improved dramatically.","I was diagnosed with COPD about 12 years ago. I started taking Advair about eight years ago. During the course of treatment I tried Spiriva, but had to stop because it was very drying. At one time I was taking Singulair, but that didn't seem to do much of anything. So I quit that. Throughout the entire period I have used Duoneb and Zyrtec. I think I was originally put on 250/50 Advair. That was increased, some years back, to 500/50, and about two years ago reduced back to 250/50. At all times I used the Advair twice a day.

My pulmonologist (also primary care physician) was not much help when I developed side effects, nor did he suggest a substitute treatment when I had to stop using Advair. I went to another doctor who treated me for adrenal fatigue and had me take natural anti-inflammatories and mucolytics to replace the Advair. I still take Duoneb and Zyrtec. I stopped taking the Advair one year ago. I am just now recovering from the adrenal problem. My COPD has not worsened.",0

Onset was rapid and anxiety producing. The extended release did  not work for me. I was tried on a variety of doses, from several small doses through out the day, with minimal effectiveness, to several higher doses per day, up to 20mg 3x a day in combination with Xanax to decrease the anxiety. I was not prescribed Xanax prior to the higher doses of Ritalin. That combination worked better than the previous, but I felt drugged out a lot. So my doctor put me on 20 mg at 6am, and noon, with a small 5-10mg dose in the evening, and Xanax only as needed. I learned to live with the anxiety and work around it. I planned my doses where the onset(1 hour) would occur when I was alone or in only with a small group of people. I had to plan everything around the Ritalin to survive with the anxiety, but it was very difficult. But it was the only way I could keep a job. Without the Ritalin I was unable to concentrate enough at work to remain employed.

3872,levoxyl,9,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,thyroid disease,the benefits i received from treatment with this unihroid drug was that my thyroid hormone levels fell back within normal range according to the many thyroid hormone profile blood tests tsh t etc which was ordered by thyroid specialist another benefit from unithroid drug was that the goiter which i had developed prior to unithroid treatment which had become increasingly larger had finally gone down to the point that my neck actually looked normal again,"My freaking hair has fallen out to the point that I am almost bald in front and around the front edges of my hair. My hair has been falling out since I began treatment with Unithroid and continues to shed today. My hair is practically bald in front and the hair on the the top and back of my head has fallen out so much that the once extremely thick hair I had is now thin, and breaks easily. From the hundreds of complaints I keep reading from other thyroid patients on the web, it appears that I am not alone in my dilemma, but to date, myself and the other hundreds of thyroid patients complaining of the same problem have yet to find a safe natural hair product to grow back hairloss from thyroid disease. Other side effects are sometimes depending on what I eat or the time of day, my pulse starts racing.","Not sure theres much to describe. I had a noticeable goiter and went to get it checked. My previous thyroid doctor gave me an iodine uptake scan, took my bloodwork and diagnosed me with Hashimotos disease. Thyroid doctor said the best thing was to let my thyroid burn itself out and then he would put me on thyroid medicine, something I now feel was a mistake and should not have been done. Per my initial thyroid doctor, Hashimotos is sometimes hard to stabilize, thus, the Unithroid drug dosage I initially received .75 mcg had to be re-adjusted several times during the first year in order to stabilize my thyroid levels. Dosage was increased to 100 mcg. then to 125 mcg. then increased to 150 mcg. At some point, during these adjustments I went to another thyroid doctor who prescribed the T3 drug called Cytomel which gave me violent heart palpitations and I was taken off of this drug. The last Unithroid prescription dosage re-adustment I was given was for 150 mcg. 1xday 6 days wk with 1/2 dosage to be taken on Sundays. Medication to be taken on an empty stomach every morning. Last year, my body became Toxic to the Unithroid as I hadn't been to see the doctor in a while and had to be taken off the medication entirely for several days. Was restarted at a low dose of 50 mcg. because the toxicity had caused my pulse to race abnormally interupting my daily activities. This dosage was gradually increased I am now being treated with a Unithroid dosage of 125 mcg. For whatever reason, this survey is being taken, it would be a blessing to myself and so many others if for once someone would develop a natural alternative to drugs like Unithroid, Synthroid etc. other than the natural alternatives on the market that are derived from Pigs glands considering more people than not today do not intake pork products of any kind.",1

I was told that it was the ""most benign medication that I was on"" so I never thought twice about popping that small pill each day.  I suffered from frequent chest infections - that is a side effect of the singulair since it blocks the leuketrines that react and cause inflammation.  When I was 25, I started having severe mood swings and had to start taking an anti-depressant.  I continued the singulair without any thoughts.  However, after my third child, we were broke and I was trying to cut some medications down to save money and I stopped the singulair for a while.  I did notice that my asthma got worse so I figured oh well, have to start the Singulair again, that's when I started having the severe mood swings again.  I started doing some research online and read an article written by a mother who lost her son to suicide and attributed it to the singulair.

Severe grogginess was slightly alleviated by caffeine (espresso) or some rest (nap) or both. Best solution appears to be to take the meds with or after food, and to attempt to get a decent amount of sleep. Also notice a certain level of dependence (NOT actual addiction though) - mostly due to return of symptoms in medication's absence. I may also have dry mouth, but I'm not sure if that's the meds or if I'm not drinking enough water.","Best way I've discovered to eliminate the side effects is to eat a protein-rich breakfast (usually egg/ham/cheese sandwich for me), then WAIT for at least a few minutes -anywhere from 15 to 60 or more- before taking the medication. Seems to retain efficacy, COMPLETELY eliminate stomach problems and GREATLY reduce grogginess -though that also seems to be partly dependent on how much sleep I get (minimum of 6 hours, preferably 8 or 9). Now that I discovered this trick, I am feeling MUCH better and no longer considering abandoning the medication! I like that it helps with sleeping quality on top of helping me focus, remember, and feel more aware of surroundings.

1600,xanax,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,anxiety,xanax for me is particualy beneficial when either i need fast relief one of the fastest acting benzodiazepines or more in a social setting because it gives a more stimulating relaxation ie relaxes you but also enables you to be social compared to alternatives,"The only thing to be aware of with this drug is that it is very short acting so while it may be perfect for situational anxiety (e.g a speech, social event, dentist etc) its not a good idea for people with more generalised anxiety as its short acting nature may mean that people get rebound anxiety and then feel the need to dose again (can lead to dependance.)",When taking as needed for particular events it works perfectly as a treatment,1

It was unclear whether or not it truly was caused by the lisinopril because the coughing did not stop when I temporarily halted treatment (for a few days).  When the coughing was at it's worst, my blood pressure went up, nullifying the effect of the linsinopril.","In spite of the irritating coughing, I continued taking the linsinopril and after numerous tests to rule out other causes of the coughing (one Dr. thought it was because of acid reflux), the coughing finally subsided.  After about a year of coughing, the coughing finally subsided and now (5-7 years later) I don't have any coughing whatsoever attributable to the lisinopril.",1

I am currently in the process of reducing my dose to see if sleep habits improve, but lab values remain at good levels","As I mentioned above, my diagnosis was based almost exclusively on labratory tests.  TSH and T4 (thyroid hormone) were found to be too high and too low, respectively.  Relatively non-descript symptoms accompanied the list of complaints at the time of diagnosis.

Once it's out of your system, it's out of your system, and yes the symptoms of acid reflux will likely return because this drug is not meant to cure any underlying condition, but simply to manage the painful symptoms of GERD and other problems with producing excess stomach acid.

3281,zoloft,1,Ineffective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,depression,emotions were somewhat blunted less moodiness,"Weight gain, extreme tiredness during the day, insomnia at night, bad effect on libido and sexual ability. Extreme lethargy.","I was on Zoloft for about 2 years total. I am extremely sensitive to medication, so I started at a dose of 25 mgs. and slowly titrated up to 100 mgs. I was unaware that this was probably too high of a dose for me. It subsequently caused me to start taking other prescriptions to mitigate some side effects. My doctor prescribed Ritalin and Focalin for the lethargy and fatigue side effects that I experienced during the day, and Ambien for the insomnia that Zoloft caused. I am still on Ambien to this day. 

The worst effect of Zoloft came when I tried to get off of it. It was total, utter hell. I have since found out that this is euphemistically called, ""discontinuation Syndrome."" 

I first cut the dose down to 50 mgs. and did not experience problems. I then slowly titrated down over several months until I came off of it completely. Over the next few weeks, I started experiencing strange, tingling sensations down my body, panic attacks, (which I had never experienced before), and extreme nausea - which became so bad, I lost 20 pounds in 6 weeks. This was all extremely traumatic as I am a type 1 diabetic who needs to eat to balance the insulin I take. The panic attacks got so bad, I had to be on Xanax XR everyday for months. I could not function normally or work. I tried to stick it out because I didn't want to go back on an SSRI after all the trouble and side effects it caused. I went to a MD who was also an alternative care specialist, thinking he could give me St. Johns Wort and I could manage with that until I got over the physical side effects of the SSRI, but it didn't work. I eventually had to go back on an SSRI just to function normally. I am on Lexapro now. I managed to be drug free for the first 40 years of my life (except for insulin), and now because of the aftermath of Zoloft, I am on Ambien, Lexapro, and Valium occasionally for anxiety. To top that off, the alternative doctor put me on a supplement that ended up being an anabolic steroid (which he called a 'nutritional supplement' and I ended up having to go on even more medication to fight the side effects that I incurred from that. All because of Zoloft. I will regret taking it the rest of my life.",0

If you take too much, you will feel sedated. Since you have to be able to clearly and honestly assess your emotions and thoughts, determining how much medication you need is tough. I found that 400mg works perfectly for me, but that's a high dose. Less than that and I can feel the medicine wearing off prematurely (I like it to last 24hrs, from sleep to sleep). More than that and I feel numb. Some might call it drowsiness, but it's more a sluggishness of the mind for me.

Before I began treating my bipolar disorder, I used to write a fair amount of fiction. It sort of flowed from me. I definitely had the artist's temperament. After Lamictal, though, that inherent creativity fizzled out. It doesn't come spilling out of me while I'm deep into a manic euphoria. I have to work at art now.

The discomfort was so unpleasant that it made me not want to take my meds, so I was not taking them consistently as prescribed.  This caused my mood to fluctuate again.  Even after I switched to the Depakote, my stomach was still uncomfortable for several weeks afterwards.  My appetite decreased and food was very unappetizing.  Certain foods that I normally enjoy, such as chicken or fish, made me feel extremely queasy when I ate them.  I did not like the physical side effect of the drug, and decided to quit my psychiatric drugs altogether - because I was no longer stable anymore!","Depakote was prescribed to me by a Kaiser psychiatrist in Pleasant Hill, CA in 2006.  The medication was given to help treat the diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder, Type II.  My disease was misdiagnosed for several years as depression, since I was never seen by a professional during hypomanic episodes, and when I did see a professional, I did not think that my manic symptoms were signs of a serious psychiatric problem.  Anti-depressant drugs were prescribed: Prozac in 2001, which had minimal effect and I stopped taking them a few months later. Wellbutrin was prescribed again for ""chronic depression"" in the spring of 2006, but this medication slowly spun me into an intense manic period.  After the manic episode, I fell very hard into a severe, suicidal depressive state.  I was voluntarily admitted to a psychiatric ward in June 2006 to keep me safe and to properly diagnose my condition.

378,lamotrigine,1,Marginally Effective,Severe Side Effects,bipolar disorder,i felt better for the first few days moodwise  but then i got depressed again  so i guess thats not a benefit,"I've always been one to freak out at the slightest appearance of illness - I have anxiety as well as bipolar disorder.  When I was told that lamotrigine (the first drug I've been on for bipolar) caused a potentially fatal rash, I decided that this time, I was going to try not to worry.  One out of ten people experience a rash on the drug - and I tried to be rational - that means I'm likely to be one of the nine that doesn't.

Oh, was I ever wrong.

Firstly, the lamotrigine didn't help with moods.  I wanted to die for two days more badly than I ever had in my life on this drug. It was excruciating.  Luckily, I have a lot of support, and I (obviously) didn't kill myself.

I couldn't sleep.  I lay awake most nights until 7am.  I eventually passed out and got maybe 4-6 hours of sleep.  This is barely better than the sleep I get when I'm hypomanic.  And we all know how bad it is when bipolar people don't sleep.  Luckily, the meds did seem to keep me from going upwards mood-wise.  I also had to pee ALL THE TIME, which was not fun.

That brings me to the rash.
I first noticed a few raised bumps on my inner forearms.  I thought it would go away, that I shouldn't freak out - I wasn't going to get the rash, right?  And the next morning, I was covered in a slightly raised, red rash, even on my face and hands.  I went to the clinic, and the doctor said I was having an allergic reaction.  He told me to just go home and stop taking the lamotrigine.  He knew nothing about it or the fact that it causes rashes.  It got worse, and by night-time I was freaked out.  I called a nurse and she told me to go to the emergency room.  I did, and they had me stay the night to make sure I didn't have Steven Johnson Syndrome.  Luckily, I don't.  I just have something called ""drug eruption.""

Even if it's not going to kill me, it's never fun being covered in red blotches.  I still am and it's been three days.  I'm afraid to go to the Starbucks around the corner.  My verdict?  Lamictal isn't worth it.  Don't risk it.","I was put on 12.5mg, then 25mg, and we were going to keep raising the dose slowly to minimize risk.",0

I started looking into medication last year.  My son was in 1st grade and had already been suspended from school 3 times.  He also was in the principals office at least 3 times a week.  He was not able to sit still or focus and was having trouble making friends because of his temper.  My husband was against medication, but I talked him into a non-stimulant. We tried Intuniv first, but, that dropped his blood pressure to a dangerous level. Then we found Strattera, our miracle drug.  Within a week we noticed a HUGE difference.  My sons outburst of rage had completely stopped.  This year he hasnt been to the principals office once and his grades are mostly A's with a few B's.  He has also become very popular this year and is invited to almost every Birthday party. I cant tell you how hard it is to see every child in the class invited to birthday parties except your son.  The best part is he is still himself.  The medication doesnt make him groggy or zombie like.  I dont know what we would have done without this drug.  The only side effect we noticed was that he would get a little more whiney than usual in the evening, when the medication was wearing off.  Other than that, we havent noticed any other side effects.

After seeing the doctor, she upped me to 40mg.  After one dosage of 40mg, I nearly passed out twice and started profusely sweating.  My hearing also went all funny.

641,seasonique,5,Moderately Effective,Moderate Side Effects,birth control,i thought the benefits would be one period every  months pregnancy prevention regulated periods i also read that they would be lighter and shorter and help with acne wrong,"Well I was quite leary about starting Seasonique, I was already taking Yaz and I loved it, but 4 periods a year why pass that up. From the moment I started taking it, it wasn't a decreased sex drive, I had none at all, which made the birth control completely useless to me. In addition to that, the acne just kept getting worse, I didn't have acne to begin with besides the occasional blemish here and there. It started getting worse on my face, then my chest, then my back, (it's not just one here or one there, my back, chest, and chin are seriously covered) I've even had one on my ribs! Crazy! My boobs no longer fit into my bras, even some shirts. It was like they doubled in size overnight (not a huge problem, just annoying with no explanation). I went out and bought a bra, a week later it didn't even cover my boobs. Lastly, I've been fretting the last 2 weeks because I still haven't gotten my period! I never had a problem with my periods showing up in the past, they've always been lighter and not very long, pretty ideal actually. The Dr. said I would bleed between... still not bleeding! I've taken 3 pregnancy tests, wasted 10 bucks on each! Oh yeah, I've been crying for no reason at all the last month. I started crying over some lady I didn't even know at work. I do not recommend taking Seasonique. I know it must be expensive although I don't know how much because my Dr. gave me sample packs and I'm not going to bother refilling it. Also they give you a coupon for $50 off and $25 off the next refill, if they are giving that much off it must be a lot. It wasn't terrible, just nothing was expected (and I still have no clue as to why I haven't gotten a period yet). I've tried several other birth control pills and never had any side effects with any of them. This is the first time I tried one where I only get a period every three months so maybe those are way different or something. If you are looking for a good pill, Yaz worked great for me and I never had any breakthrough bleeding, mood swings, loss of sex drive, acne or anything. Hope this helps.","1 pill every day for 12 weeks, then 1 week of period pills",1

i didnt gain weight or increase in appetite  i struggled with appetite actually and at times had to force myself to eat","This drug gave me alot of strange sensations.  When I turned my head left or right, I got this mild scratchy or whip like noise in my ears along with a tingling in my head; also my vision seemed to briefly black out.  This lasted for many months. I thought it was perhaps not real or just in my head. My psychiatrist called it ""tracking"" and confirmed it as a known side affect with paxil use.  I didn't bother to worry anymore about it.  This passed after some months.  I no longer get it.  I felt very dizzy and sleepy at times.  I'd fall asleep anywhere.

My oncologist said it increased bone mass, so she wanted to use that first to counteract the bone mass-decreasing side effect of the aromatase inhibitors.  Their protocol is to use Tamoxifen for 2 years, then switch to an aromatase inhibitor for 3 years. However, I had some uterine bleeding ( I am post-menopausal) so they switched to Femara early. Tamoxifen may cause an increase in uterine cancer, which my grandmother had. The most annoying side effect of Femara is the increase in joint pain.  NSAIDs and glucosamine help somewhat but have their own side effects.  That said, I am willing to continue Femara for the next 2 years to help prevent cancer reccurence.  I read in the literature (Medscape) that 51% of women do not complete their 5 yrs of either drug, and my guess is because of side effects. I take supplemental calcium also to slow the bone loss.",0

My case probably isn't a perfect control because I lost a high paying job, moved to another state, and moved in with my girlfriend when I began taking the medication.

I can attribute some of the loss of libido to job related stress and moving in with my girlfriend of 5 years.  I would guess the effects on libido would be very minimal had my job and living situations remained constant.

I'm overall much happier having thicker hair than I would be with a consistent sex drive.  I am able to get more work done and focus more on important life goals than being constantly distracted with sex.  Instead of wanting sex 5 times per week, I only want it twice per month now.  Again, this is probably a plus","I started slowing losing hair when I was 23-24.  The hair loss was unnoticeable until I turned 27.  My receding hairline started to become very apparent at 27, especially in my part line.  I began taking propecia when I turned 28 and it appears to have regrown hair on the back and sides of my scalp and has slowed my receding hairline.  Unfortunately, it appears that I am still developing a minor bald spot in the middle of my scalp.  

Based on my current rate of hair loss, I'm guessing that I will maintain a healthy head of hair for the next 4-5 years.  At 35, I probably won't care how my hair looks because I'll be well out of the dating game.  

I don't think Propecia is a cure-all for my particular pattern of baldness, but I feel it would be highly effective for others.  Anyone who is experiencing baldness at the back of scalp would benefit greatly.  The receding hairline will probably continue, but at a much slower pace.  I may eventually go completely bald regardless, but I honestly feel I've saved 3-5 years of youthful appearance.",1

2955,zyban,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,smoking,after smoking for  years i no longer smoke and cant believe i ever did,ZERO side effects.,"I held on to the prescription for 18 months, but never filled it - until I decided I should, completely expecting to fail.  I did as prescribed and continued to smoke through the first week or so.  One night I saw only six cigarettes left. I became anxious and actually went out and BOUGHT TWO PACKS! Leaving the store, I felt like a junkie who just scored a fix, and, I was disgusted.  But - I smoked them, finishing the two packs in a bit over a week, which was much less smoking than I had ever done.  ..And,.. after smoking the last remaining cigarette, I magically never smoked again.  

It's been over a year and I can almost qualify as one who has no cravings because they are so, so rare (maybe once every four or five months) and they last for less than a nano-second. 

I'm so smoke free and amazed at two things: 1. How easy it was to stop because of the Zyban, and, 2. That I ever smoked at all - even though I did for 41 years. Other than being smart enough to finally get the prescription filled, I deserve no credit because there has been no need for any great will on my part. I have absolutely no cravings, no desires, no urges to have to will myself through.  They simply don't happen.",1

I was slightly discouraged about my weight gain, a few pounds here and there, but 2 years later I am 40lbs heavier than I was when I started this pill.

I stopped taking this pill the other day because I couldnt stand always being tired, fatigued, moody, and the headaches were unbearable.

The only thing that could be mentioned is that if one embarks on a significant exercise routine such as elleptical stairstep machine for 30+ minutes/day and keeps up the exercise for weeks on end while at the same time taking the Atacand, one may end up with a [not undesirable] blood pressure in the 112/65 range.","The Atacand worked well IF taken routinely without skipping days.  It takes a while for the regulation to start, ie, you can't begin from scratch taking the Atacand the first morning and expect proper blood pressure regulation that afternoon.  Doesn't work that quickly.  There is a tendency, after taking the medication consistently and seeing your pressure get well under control, to think that maybe you can stop or at least taper off of the Atacand.  One may try this but will find that the best regimen is consistency.  It did work well for me and keeps me under 120/80.",1

Some anti-depressants may carry a small risk of side-effects to the baby in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy.  My ob-gyn felt that taking Wellbutrin may reduce these risks.   After 1 or 2 months on Wellbutrin, I began to feel very irrtable and anxious.  My chest began to tighten painfully with even the thought of something stressful.  After 4 months on Wellbutrin, I had my first panic attack ever.  I threw the pills in the trash and went to see a psychiatrist.  The psychiatrist told me that there was no medically proven benefit to switching to Wellbutrin, and put me back on Zoloft.  I feel much better!",0

I felt like I was having a panic attack (which I had never had before but friends have) so I took deep, slow breaths to calm myself.  When I felt I was alright, I returned to the freeway but had to pull over once more before I reached home.  I have never been in an accident nor had this feeling before so could not rationalize what was happening. After it happened a few more times, I put paper bags in my car (for breathing) and started using side roads, where I had no problems.  When I went to my doctor, I told him about my anxiety and he prescribed Paxil for me.

I could be sitting or laying down in bed & these ""spells"" would come on out of the blue & very regularly.  I spent one night up all night laying on the couch because it was so bad that I was afraid that if I fell asleep I might not wake up. I tried to pretend it would go way at first but then made an appointment with my Dr. first & then a cardiologist, it was just too scary. My Dr. didn't believe that it was the medicine. By the time I could get in to see the cardiologist & have the heart monitor holster, echocardiogram etc. done I had been off the medicine for 2 weeks & the symptoms had lessened & of course did not appear while I was being tested. The Dr. thought I was crazy & that there was no way it was the medicine & that maybe I was having panic attacks.  I have never had a panic attack in my life & I have had similar heart rhythm symptoms with other meds that quit when I stopped taking them & I know my own body.  It WAS the lovastatin.  It took a year & a half before I started feeling normal again & didn't have these attacks come on sometimes.  I truly believe the lovastatin had an affect on my heart that took that long to get better. I will NEVER take another cholesterol med again that has the possible side affects of affecting muscles.  The heart is a muscle.  I also found that other people have had this same experience while taking statins while I was researching this on the internet.

If you can't get to the pills within the first 24 hours, there is really not much good they can do after that, from my experience.

This was especially true before a period or when I was under stress at work.  I decided to see a dermatologist as I was sick of the acne.  I started Yaz which was alright, as well as Retin-A.  This didn't seem to address the larger lesions so my dr. prescribed Solodyn.  Looking back now, I think the side-effect started in the first couple weeks, I just didn't identify them as related to the drug.  I thought I was suffering from carpal tunnel at work and could explain why my knees hurt so much.  I was just about to go to an orthopod when I decided to investigate the Solodyn more.  I read about the joint pain and Lupus-like symptoms, stopped the drug immediately and called my dr. to get in and see her.  She did some bloodwork and I had a positive ANA blood result (mid-positive, not low).  This is one indicator of lupus.  My dermatologist was adamant that the symptoms would go away now.  I called the office again a week later as I was still having strong side effects and was pretty worried.  I got a phone call back that basically said ""hello, hypochondriac, you do not have lupus.""  Then my eye pain started and my eye turned totally red.  I went to my GP who referred me to an opthalmologist who diagnosed iritis and I started 7 weeks of drops.  She also referred me to a rheumatologist who ran a number of tests and told me she's seen minocycline drugs do this to people a lot and she would never take one or have her children take one - great.

For the first month I felt exceptionally good and I was telling everyone how great it was but the euphoria came crashing down and I went into a deep depression.

I had a similar reaction in respect to rage and disinhibition from taking Zoloft when I was younger which altered my life substantially and now Champix has put the nail in the coffin.  Apparently these two drugs have a similar mechanism but Pfizer with held this information and marketed the drug in a deceiving way not mentioning any of the neuro-psychiatric and mind altering side effects of the drug when it first hit the market in order to boost sales of their poison.  The medical community has know for quite some time that dopamine plays a role in mood regulation and the fact the Champix targets the �pleasure centre� of the brain makes them grossly negligent for not investigating this further and informing consumers.  Many people including myself (I turned down a prescription of Zyban due to my experience with Zoloft) would not have taken it if we would have been informed of the risks and Pfizer knew that.

I waited about 15-20 minutes after cleansing to apply a dime size of the medication. My doctor recommended doing so to make the skin less sensitive and more receptive of the drug. My doctor also told me that the use of sunscreen was imperative while using Tretinoin because retinol can cause the skin to become sensitive to sunlight.

Within days of decreasing the Citalopram I felt so much smarter. The Mirtazapine has really allayed the depression and most of my anxiety.  I do also take Buproprion and the two things do seem to allay depression and anxiety.

I definitely recommend trying Mirtazapine if you're depressed, especially if you either hate SSRIs, or haven't founnd anything else which works. It doesn't really have such bad side effects. And my dreaming has become really interesting. I actually can't wait to go to bed now.  I did have a nightmare the first night I took it, but not since then. Instead I have had all sorts of dream desire fulfillment, and it's odd how much that can make you feel more resourceful for the rest of your day.

I also wasn't able to work for the last two years because of moodiness and benzodiazpine use for anxiety and sleep.  Now I have cut out all thosoe medications and I really do feel much better.

One month my local pharmacy was out of the trade brand and offered to fill the prescription with the generic brand and because I was in a hurry to catch a plane to go on a vacation, I agreed, thinking they had to be similar.  Wrong!  To begin with, the generic patch is twice the size and thickness of the trade brand - don't even think of wearing tight clothes while sporting one of these!  (I laughlingly told my husband we could always use one to patch a flat tire if needed, but soon it wasn't so funny.)  Within a day or two I knew something was wrong, but hadn't yet identified the problem.  I couldn't stop crying about nothing in particular.  It seemed as if overnight, my world had become very sad and depressing. I immediately began to gain weight, despite no change in my dietary habits.  After finally putting two and two together, I ripped it off and contacted my local pharmacist to see if anyone else had complained of similar experiences.  After rechecking my prescription, the pharmacist noticed my physician had marked ""no generics"".  Apparently, he had a good reason for this choice as this was not his usual stance on generics.  The pharmacist refilled my prescription with the trade brand and all was quickly back to normal.

I sometimes have trouble thinking or speaking my thoughts concisely, moodiness, somewhat depressed, shortness of breath at times, dizziness, occasional vision problems, some numbness or odd sensations in legs or arms etc.  However, I can't say for sure if any of these side effects/symptoms are from taking Neurontin, the lidoderm patch or for some other reason (stresses...).","Ten years ago I had spinal chord surgery to remove a tumor.  Fortunately it was benign.  The down side is that it pressed on the nerves so much that it permanently damaged them.  The greatest nerve pain I have is from the center of my chest all the way around on the right side (breast area) to the center of my back on the right.  The skin in that area is so sensitive that any clothing even slightly rubbing on it can cause great pain.  I have been very happy with Neurotin for the most part.  I know it is working because if I am late taking my next dose (every eight hours) the pain starts to increases.  The Neurotin alone does not work well.  In addition, I have to wear a Lidoderm patch.

1266,provigil,1,Marginally Effective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,daytime sleepiness,virtually nil please please read on,"If you take a look at the side effects the FDA requires Provigil manufacturer Cephalon to list, you will find the usual stomach aches, headaches etc.. Such side effects are so common that virtually every new prescription medication ends up listing them, which is why most of us don't bother reading the side effect profile for meds. However, failing to look at the side effects for Provigil could end up costing you your life. Provigil of course does list the usual side effects, yes, but ther is one side effect listed that is rarely included as a medication side effect.  Further, even if you should happen to actually read the list of Provigil's side you are not likely to know what it means. The side effect is called ""vasodilatation"", and the manufacturer reported to the FDA that it occurred to 1 out of every 50 test subjects while it happened to 0 out of every 50 who took the placebo. What is ""vasodilatation""?  Vasodilatation, nearly always referred to as the more recognizable ""vasodilation"", refers to the general relaxation of blood vessels, a phenomenon that usually ends up causing a small drop in blood pressure but sometimes causes a significant blood pressure drop, when it is then called hypotension.  And, if you'll read on, you'll see why for me, and potentially for 1 out of every 50 users of Provigil, it very nearly killed me.  

After 7 weeks on Provigil, with the last week having been increased from 200mg to 300mg per day, I awoke one morning in a highly delusional state, speaking of non-existent farm animals wandering around the kitchen table where my wife and I were seated. After apparently collapsing in my bedroom, I was taken to ER, which quickly determined that I was critically hypotensive (low blood pressure of 72/35). I quickly lapsed into cardiogenic shock, a condition where the heart all but stops pumping blood and one of the deadliest of all medical crises. Even among those who are still alive upon arrival at an ER,  70% to 80% die within hours or a few days. Those who survive likely do so, as I did, with kidneys in acute failure and brain damage similar to what is sustained by near-drowning victims who have been resuscitated by a lengthy CPR session.","My ER doctor immediately paged the cardiologist on call. Arriving quickly, he assessed my condition and determined that my only chance of survival was a transport to a regional heart center 35 miles away. As he awaited the ambulance, he took me to my local hospital's heart catheterization lab, not to put a stent in, but to push a tiny balloon through  my femoral artery to a destination next to my aorta, after which a tiny battery powered air pump was used to inflate the balloon and keep it inflated. The balloon (called an intra-aortic balloon pump) works by temporarily filling the empty space around the heart, then applying continuous gentle pressure to my aorta in an effort to keep my blood pressure from additional falling past the small amount that would otherwise kill me. Arriving at the heart center I was unconscious and would lapse into a coma for 9 days, kept alive by mechanical ventilation through a tube inserted through my throat to my lungs (""I'm in"", the TV doctors always say when the get the insertion right).",0

I believe it contributed to  a short bout of stomach upset and heavy bowel movements however this problem subsided fairly quickly. I think it also contributes to my eyes feeling dryer than usual. Since I am post menopausal dry eyes is a huge problem.,I was supposed to take 2 tablets a day 1 in the morning and 1 in the evening. I followed this regimen for 1 and a half weeks then I decided to reduce the dosage myself to 1 per day.

We were on vacation in another state and all of a sudden I began to feel extremely horrible-- very weak, with a rapid heart beat.  We were getting ready to get on an airplane and come home.  So I thought if I can just get to my home town and get to a hospital, they can surely figure out what is wrong with me.  We arrived at our home airport and then we went straight to the emergency room, where they ran several tests and I was there for several hours, but they could find nothing wrong with me.  So they told me to go to my regular doctor the next day, which I did of course and he ran a blood test and found that it was the thyroid medication that was causing my problems.","I was able to find an osteopathic doctor who put me on a natural thyroid, not a synthetic, he calld it a dessicated thyroid which came from an animal source, so I was able to get off the synthetic.

The positive effects that I noticed out weighed the negative ones. The side effects that i noticed were very slight peeling of the skin and a very very slight burning sensation. The burning sensation however, completely went away with continued use of the medicine. I believe this is so because my skin became more and more tolerant the more I used it.",My treatment details are as follows: I Used Avita (Tretinoin) every night after cleansing my face. I waited about 15-20 minutes after cleansing to apply a dime size of the medication. My doctor recommended doing so to make the skin less sensitive and more receptive of the drug. My doctor also told me that the use of sunscreen was imperative while using Tretinoin because retinol can cause the skin to become sensitive to sunlight. So every morning before leaving the house I made sure to apply a sunscreen.,1

While at the ER I was given solumedrol and benadryl.  Since I have asthma, a prednisone taper was prescribed in the event that a rebound effect occured, which it did.  I began the taper immediately upon the worsening of symptoms.  It took about 3 hours for the prednisone to begin working.  During that time, there was a back and forth response from my body as it fought the prednisone for control.  During this event, I learned that I will always use my Epipen in the future as adrenalin is not always part of the protocol at the ER.

More recently I find that on the rare occasions that I use Serax, I wake up with a headache if I take a full capsule.  I find using a half a capsule seems to work fine without giving me a headache.","My doctor tried various antidepressant type sleep medications to help me to sleep but they did not help at all.  They left me feeling groggy and with a strange disconnected feeling.   We also tried Ambien but this only helped me get about 2 hours of sleep and then I'd wake up and feel strange.

154,zomig,7,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,migraine,the benefits of taking zomig are suppression of migraineheadache pain for at least  hours  sometimes the migraine would return after this time but usually it went away completely until the next attack,The side effects of taking Zomig for me are inability to wake (if taken before sleeping) and extreme drowsiness/fogginess if taken while remaining awake.,"I can take Zomig to alleviate any headache pain (including hangovers) which is odd because my doctor told me it would only work on migraines.  The sooner I  take it the faster it works.  If I take it and lie down in a dark room it works faster but I have a very difficult time waking up unless a full night has passed.  If I take it during the day and have to be at work it takes much longer to work (around three hours).  It also makes me feel very foggy and I cannot drive. Sometimes I have to take a second dose, but it has always worked after that.  Sometimes if I catch the headache early enough and go to bed I can cut the dose in half and it still works.  It's success seems to be closely tied to the ability to get away from light, sounds and smells that tend to aggrivate the migraine. If I wait too long to take it, nausea sets in and I cannot keep the medication down.  Then I need to take the sublingual dose, which I don't like to purchase because I can't divide the doses at all.

I would meet with the doctor's weekly and was put on a low-fat diet and asked to do moderate exercise of 30-40 minutes 3 days a week during this study. At the time I was Age 39, 5 ft 7 and 200 lbs. and a cholesterol level of 265 (you had to have a BMI of 30 percent in order to participate in study, and I just made it per the weight and height chart). Half of the study participants were put on a placebo pill and half were put on Orlistat (Xenical). They did not tell the participants during the study if they had the placebo or if they had the Orlistat. At the end of the 3 month study, I lost 32 lbs. (down to 168 lbs.) and my cholesterol went from 265 to 199. I was told at that time I was taking Orlistat. The participants who took Orlistat lost more weight than the ones who took placebo and did the low-fat diet. I can only remember once having what may have been an oily stool. I never had cramps, diarrhea or any type of bowel accidents. It is now 2010, and I have put on 20 lbs. since. I am considering trying to get my family doctor to prescribe Orlistat. I have not heard anything negative about the medication, except for the side effects of oily stools, etc. I believe the people who have experienced the bad side effects are people who are continuing to eat fatty foods (such as pizza, cheeseburgers, etc.) and continue to take the Orlistat.

Well, that's why I am taking it! If you don't want to feel drowsy, then Ativan is probably not for you. Another drawback is that if it is used too often, your body will get used to it and you may have to bump up your dose. When I first began taking Ativan, I only needed half a mg. to fall asleep, so I would cut a tablet in half. I only use it 3 or 4 times a month, but even at that dosage, after having used it for several years, I now find I have to take a whole tablet in order for the Ativan to help me sleep.","After having this prescribed to me by my dentist, I knew it was very effective. I'd tried various other medications prescribed by my doctor to help me sleep, so I told him I'd like to try Ativans as they had worked so well as a relaxant before a dental extraction. We worked together to come up with a dosage, and he then prescribed the 1mg. As stated before, the one mg. was more than enough at first, so I would cut the tablets in half and for the first couple years this worked just fine.

My doctor was very careful to start me out on 50 MG and move me up VERY slowly to the 200 MG 2x per day, which I understand is a very high dosage and took all of 4 years to get to that dosage.  I was monitored every 30 days to ensure that I was not losing too much weight, having any type of eye problems, or numbness in my hands or feet--the eye problems, and numbness I never experienced; but was always told that if I did experience even a hint of these things, that I would have to stop the medication immediately--so my doctor does constantly ask me about those things.  I have also read that Topamax has been used to treat alcoholics, and have noticed that since taking it, I have no desire to drink alcohol at all--but I am not an alcoholic--just a unique observation.  It really just seems like a great drug!!","I am still taking it to manage both  my migraines and my mood disorder--200 MG 2x per day.  I take 2 in the AM and 2 in the PM.  It is prescribed by my Neurologist and managed by him mostly; and my psychatrist also works with him, because if I ever go off of the drug, I would be required to go onto a mood stabalizer due to the bi-polar disorder.

I have absolutely no memory of five days of my life.  I have done research into this phenomenon, and must warn all that this seems to occur most often in indiviguals with dopamine/GABA reuptake variants- such as those with ADHD, Parkinsons, and also PTSD.  Diazepam is a ""bandaid"" and offers no long-term therapeutic benefit whatsoever.  In fact, ""rebound"" anxiety and profound depression are common.

Seemed like my acne was getting worse, but I was told, my skin was purging the acne out, and that is exactly what it did!","I went once a month to see my dermatologist, which he would look at and then prescribe me another refill of 30 pills, one to be taken everyday.  I had no insurance, so at the time I was using Accutane, it was $90.00, for a 30 day supply.  

I had to go once a month for a blood test, to make sure all organs were working properly. I had to go to the hospital, because the dermatologist I used at the time, did not have lab testing equipment, that could be done at his office. 

The only other thing I used and that was advised to me was to use a mild moisturizer, and the was Oil of Olay, they now call it Olay, and to use Dove soap.  I drank like a gallon of water a day, because I got cotton mouth, but that came and went, and was never constant. (I was never told to use sunscreen!)

After, about the end of the 2nd month of using Accutane, my face was just about free of any acne.  By the third month, my acne was just about gone.  The rest of the following months, I was free of acne.  The following months my face stayed dry all the time, and I just used Olay, in the morning and in the evening.

When I woke up from my nap my upset stomach did not go away and I felt naushes. I tried to drink a Powerade and eat a few preztles, that did not help at all. So for dinner I ate some soup and the upset stomach, nausea and chest pain still continued. I went to bed and woke up with stomach pains and still nausea. I ended up vomiting but only a little.

I did experience some headaches and a bit of a �spacey� feeling in the head when I first started taking it. Overall, I would say that the major issue I experienced which I am considering a side effect was a dulling of the emotions. While it helped me to curb my frustration and irritability, it also dulled my ability to feel great happiness or excitement about anything. My husband complained that I just stopped caring about everything. I also became completely disinterested in sex.","I am unsure of what the treatment details mean. I took this drug for about a year under the supervision of my general practioner. I took a 10 mg dosage the entire time. This dose was never increased.

I was prescribed this for mild, yet persistent acne. While it did help clear up the acne it also caused me to continue to get more pimples in areas I didnt normally get them. So it was a slight paradox. 

I would have continued to use the medication of it wasnt for the dryness and tighness I used to get after water touched my skin. My skin never felt comfortable. I gave it a good 5 months but my skin never seemed to adjust.

After this I rinse with warm water to make sure all soap residue is gone. I then LIGHTLY pat my face dry with the softest towel I can find. Let the face AIR DRY for 15 minutes, then a PEA size amount of Retin-A can be applied to the face. This little amount is for the WHOLE face. Once the whole face is covered with the Retin-A , let it sink in for 5 minutes, then apply a moisturizer. I like to use Cetaphil cream for this or Moisturel.

Hot flushes would also be sporadic. I also had a sense of ""scatterbrain"" ie my mind felt jumbled up, I could not make quick decisions, everything seemed blurry in my head. My stomach suffered from bloating  and a sense of squirmishness.  On some days I vomitted.Over time this decreased, and eventually after 1 and 1/2 years these symptons stopped. The time line probably could be reduced, but on ocassions of sickness, I stopped taking clomid and began the next month. My skin had a positive impact - it was very clear and had a very soft feel/texture. I had a very heightened sense of smell as well.","After a first successful pregnancy, my attempts at a second were not succeeding. Medical tests showed my ovulation hormones were very low and my period was very erratic and sometimes non existant. This coincides with my history of polycistic ovariaries. A dosage of Clomid was initiated with the aim of increasing hormones to correct levels, produsing measurable ovulation and resulting regular menstrual periods. Clomid caused some quite uncomfortable side effects initially ie dizziness, vomitting, unclear mental thoughts and stomach sensitivity, which onoccassons sent me to bed for recovery. Over time as my body absorbed clomid and adjusted to the hew level of hormones, the side effects stopped. Whilst not inducing a pregancy, it allowed my obstercian to focus on other possible problems. Overall, Clomid did exactly what it is designed to do - stimulate ovulation. I would recommend its use.",1

I was originally prescribed this drug for pain management of a chronic pain problem, but in a lower dose. While I feel that is has only had a minimal effect of lmy pain, the higher dose has gotten my seizures under control.
